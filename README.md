This project aimed to build an intelligent forecasting system that predicts GDP per capitaâ€”a key economic indicator representing the average income of individuals in a country and a critical measure of national prosperity. The model leverages a diverse set of historical data, including economic, demographic, and social indicators such as inflation rates, unemployment, population growth, and government spending.

Using supervised machine learning techniques, primarily regression models, the system was trained to identify complex patterns and correlations in the data. The core prediction engine was built in Python, with preprocessing and model evaluation ensuring high accuracy and robustness. The model was then deployed via a Flask-based web interface, allowing users to input relevant parameters and receive real-time predictions.

This solution can assist policymakers, economists, investors, and development agencies in anticipating economic trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for long-term planning and financial analysis. The integration of machine learning with a user-friendly web application showcases a practical approach to combining data science with real-world economic forecasting.
